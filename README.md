Resume Classification

The business objective of NLP (Natural Language Processing) resume classification is to leverage automated text analysis techniques to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness of the hiring process. By applying NLP algorithms to resumes and job applications, organizations aim to achieve benefits like Efficient candidate screening, Enhanced candidate selection, and Reduction of manual effort and costs.

To achieve this objective, several steps are typically undertaken:
* Data Extracting and Preparation: Worked on raw data

* Extracting skills: Wordcloud

* Model Training and Evaluation: TF-IDF(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

* Supervised machine learning: K-Nearest Neighbors, LGBoost Classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, Naive Bayes

* Deployment using Streamlit
